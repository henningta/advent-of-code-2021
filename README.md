# Advent of Code 2021

My code submissions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) daily challenges, written in Python.

## Local development
- Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory
- Run `python -m venv venv` to set up the virtual environment (Python 3)
- Run the appropriate activation scripts in the newly-created `venv` folder to activate the virtual environment in your terminal
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the virtual environment
- Execute each `.py` file in the `src/day*` folders individually, directly with Python
